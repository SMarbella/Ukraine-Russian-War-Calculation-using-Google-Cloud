# Ukraine Russian War Calculation using Google Cloud
I used SQL to create queries that calculate the total and average numbers of casualties for both personnel and vehicles per day and per week. To visualize the results, I used Google Data Studio to create interactive line charts. They show the total number of casualties per vehicle and personnel type over time.

The queries I created were these questions:
- How many vehicles and personnel did Russia lose in total (May 1, 2022)?
- What is the average number of each vehicle and personnel lost within a day?
- What is the average number of each vehicle and personnel lost within a week?

Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/2022-ukraine-russian-war?resource=download&select=russia_losses_personnel.csv

According to Kaggle, the 2022 Russia Ukraine War dataset updates weekly. It includes data from February 25, 2022, to the present. I took the screenshots on  ‎May ‎1, ‎2022, so the visuals do not have the latest information.
