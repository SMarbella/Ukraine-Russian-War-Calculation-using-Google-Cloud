# Ukraine Russian War Calculation using Google Cloud
I used SQL to create queries that calculate the total and average numbers of casualties for both personnel and vehicles per day and per week. To visualize the results, I used Google Data Studio to create interactive line charts. They show the total number of casualties per vehicle and personnel type over time.

According to Kaggle, the 2022 Russia Ukraine War dataset updates weekly. It includes data from February 25, 2022, to the present. I took the screenshots on  ‎May ‎1, ‎2022, so the visuals do not have the latest information.
