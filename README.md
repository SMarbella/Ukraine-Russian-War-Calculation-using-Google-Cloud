# Ukraine Russian War Calculation using Google Cloud
I used SQL to create queries that calculate the total and average numbers of casualties for both personnel and vehicles per day and per week. To visualize the results, I used Google Data Studio to create an interactive line chart. It shows the comparisons between the total number of casualties per vehicle type and personnel type over time.
